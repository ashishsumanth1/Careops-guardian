## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Fatigue following physiotherapy | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Nightmares leading to disorientation | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | Delayed meals | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly
- Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents
- Daily Parkinson's symptom log
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
