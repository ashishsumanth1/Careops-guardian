## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Over-stimulation causing shutdown
- High-salt meals
- Large groups or overlapping conversations
- Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation
- Emotional distress increasing heart rate
- Missed diuretics

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Pressure damage over sacrum
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively
- Flash pulmonary oedema
- Dizziness when diuretics peak
- Depression linked to communication barriers

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Accepts strip wash in bathroom if preferred staff present; otherwise, offer basin wash in-room.
- Breakfast best served in dining room window seat with porridge and stewed fruit.

### Daytime
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.

### Evening & Night
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation | Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
