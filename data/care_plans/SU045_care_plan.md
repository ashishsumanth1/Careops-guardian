## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Sensory overload in dining room
- Emotional distress increasing heart rate
- Fatigue after 30 minutes upright
- Constipation increasing confusion
- Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation
- Missed lactulose doses

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Shoulder subluxation during transfers
- Exit seeking and community disorientation
- Depression linked to communication barriers

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Sensory overload in dining room | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Constipation increasing tone | If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Repositioning chart maintained
- Weekly skin inspections
- Mood log linked to therapy engagement
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift

**Documentation expectations:**

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.
