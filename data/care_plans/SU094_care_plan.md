## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension | Transfers require two staff with Sara Stedy, experiences freezing episodes each morning. | Daily Parkinson's symptom log / Linked team: SALT |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy | Baseline saturation 92%; productive cough in mornings. | Nebuliser maintenance log / Linked team: Respiratory Nurse |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity | Requires full hoist transfers, bespoke seating, and passive physiotherapy. | Repositioning chart maintained / Linked team: Occupational Therapist |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues | Requires structured prompts, risk of confabulation, takes lactulose. | Exit-seeking log / Linked team: Psych liaison |

**Professional network actively involved:** Neurology clinic, SALT, Physiotherapist, Respiratory Nurse, Dietitian, Occupational Therapist, Hepatology clinic, Psych liaison

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Rapid positional changes causing dizziness
- Anxiety causing rapid breathing
- Chest infections
- Sensory overload in dining room
- Delayed Parkinson's medication
- Constipation increasing confusion

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Syncope due to blood pressure drops
- CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription
- Verbal aggression when challenged
- Muscle rigidity leading to pain
- Pressure damage over sacrum

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Medication window 07:30-08:00; crush tablets only if SALT guidance permits.
- Accepts strip wash in bathroom if preferred staff present; otherwise, offer basin wash in-room.

### Daytime
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.
- Risk of distress if communal TV is loud; offer headphones or quiet lounge alternative.

### Evening & Night
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Allow extra time for verbal responses
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Increase observation frequency during infection
- Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- OT checks splints quarterly
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- Physio reviews positioning plan monthly
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Fatigue following physiotherapy | Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Constipation increasing confusion | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | Report any new weakness immediately |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly
- Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents
- Daily Parkinson's symptom log
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily
- Weight monthly
- Nebuliser maintenance log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
