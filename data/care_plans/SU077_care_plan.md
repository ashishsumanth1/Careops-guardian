## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected
- Physio reviews positioning plan monthly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Male voices shouting | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Missed lactulose doses | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Over-stimulation causing shutdown | For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.

- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
