## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Constipation increasing confusion

- Footwear rubbing or slipping

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Hypoglycaemia during night
- Risk of missing medication due to confusion
- Dizziness when diuretics peak
- Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**

- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Missed diuretics | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | High-sugar snacks left in communal areas | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Constipation increasing confusion | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
