## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Missed lactulose doses
- Constipation increasing confusion
- Sensory overload in dining room
- Rapid positional changes causing dizziness
- Missed diuretics
- Smell of disinfectant similar to past events

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Heightened anxiety leading to aggression
- Skin breakdown over ankles
- Meltdowns leading to self-injury
- Flash pulmonary oedema
- Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash)

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.
- Wake between 06:30-07:00; offer warm lemon water before personal care.

### Daytime
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.
- May nap after lunch; ensure heels are offloaded and oxygen concentrator checked.

### Evening & Night
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Use tablet-based social stories before appointments
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Learning disability nurse provides quarterly review
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected
- Psychiatrist oversees medication annually

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | High-salt meals | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Missed lactulose doses | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Male voices shouting | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Staff speaking over each other | Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Delayed Parkinson's medication | If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly
- Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents
- Daily Parkinson's symptom log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
