## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Nightmares leading to disorientation
- Dusty environments
- Poor positioning leading to pain
- Infections leading to hyperglycaemia
- Constipation increasing tone
- Footwear rubbing or slipping

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating
- Suicidal ideation (historical)
- Pressure damage over sacrum
- Depression linked to communication barriers
- Hypoglycaemia during night

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Ensure podiatry-approved footwear only
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques
- Report any new weakness immediately
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- CMHT reviews antidepressant therapy bi-monthly
- Physio reviews positioning plan monthly
- OT checks splints quarterly
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Unexpected touch from behind | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Footwear rubbing or slipping | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Dusty environments | Increase observation frequency during infection |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening
- Weekly foot integrity log
- Pain score recorded twice daily
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
