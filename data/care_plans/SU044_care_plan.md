- Ensure podiatry-approved footwear only
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- Psychiatrist oversees medication annually

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | High-sugar snacks left in communal areas | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Strong smells in dining room | Allow recovery time without demands |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Missed lactulose doses | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
