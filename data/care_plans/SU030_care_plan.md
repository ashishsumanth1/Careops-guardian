## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |

| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension | Transfers require two staff with Sara Stedy, experiences freezing episodes each morning. | Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents / Linked team: Physiotherapist |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy | Requires foot inspections and carbohydrate counting support. | Pain score recorded twice daily / Linked team: Pain Clinic |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression | May decline care, experiences nightmares, hypervigilant to loud voices. | Safeguarding notes kept confidentially / Linked team: Psychologist |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity | Requires full hoist transfers, bespoke seating, and passive physiotherapy. | Repositioning chart maintained / Linked team: Occupational Therapist |

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Nightmares leading to disorientation
- Infections leading to hyperglycaemia
- Male voices shouting
- Fatigue after 30 minutes upright
- High-sugar snacks left in communal areas
- Constipation increasing confusion

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Syncope due to blood pressure drops
- Shoulder subluxation during transfers
- Hypoglycaemia during night
- Muscle rigidity leading to pain
- Heightened anxiety leading to aggression

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Medication window 07:30-08:00; crush tablets only if SALT guidance permits.
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- Risk of distress if communal TV is loud; offer headphones or quiet lounge alternative.
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.

### Evening & Night
- If restless, offer folded laundry task or memory box to redirect energy.
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Allow extra time for verbal responses
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Use sling specified by physio only

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Report any new weakness immediately
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- OT checks splints quarterly
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Shoulder subluxation during transfers | Over-stimulation causing shutdown | If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Muscle rigidity leading to pain | Thin fluids leading to coughing | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Missed lactulose doses | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | Delayed meals | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
