- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Male voices shouting | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Conversations about alcohol | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |

**Escalation reminders:**
