## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Use tablet-based social stories before appointments

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room
- Allow recovery time without demands

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- Psychiatrist oversees medication annually
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Dizziness when diuretics peak | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Constipation increasing tone | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Missed lactulose doses | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Strong smells in dining room | Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- Repositioning chart maintained
- Weekly skin inspections
- Mood log linked to therapy engagement

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).
