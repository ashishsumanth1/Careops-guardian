## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema | Requires leg elevation in recliner, fluid restriction 1500ml/day. | Ankle girth measured twice weekly / Linked team: Community Heart Failure Nurse |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension | Transfers require two staff with Sara Stedy, experiences freezing episodes each morning. | Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents / Linked team: SALT |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression | May decline care, experiences nightmares, hypervigilant to loud voices. | Safeguarding notes kept confidentially / Linked team: Psychologist |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity | Requires full hoist transfers, bespoke seating, and passive physiotherapy. | Weekly skin inspections / Linked team: Occupational Therapist |

**Professional network actively involved:** Community Heart Failure Nurse, GP, Neurology clinic, SALT, Physiotherapist, Community Mental Health Team, Psychologist, Occupational Therapist

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation
- High-salt meals
- Thin fluids leading to coughing
- Missed diuretics
- Constipation increasing tone
- Unexpected touch from behind

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Shoulder subluxation during transfers
- Aspiration during meals
- Pressure damage over sacrum
- Skin breakdown over ankles
- Syncope due to blood pressure drops

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Uses reminiscence playlist while carers complete dressing to reduce anxiety.
- Breakfast best served in dining room window seat with porridge and stewed fruit.

### Daytime
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.
- May nap after lunch; ensure heels are offloaded and oxygen concentrator checked.

### Evening & Night
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- OT checks splints quarterly
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- Physio reviews positioning plan monthly
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Poor positioning leading to pain | If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Fatigue following physiotherapy | Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Unexpected touch from behind | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly
- Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents
- Daily Parkinson's symptom log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
