## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Use sling specified by physio only

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- Report any new weakness immediately

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | High-salt meals | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Shoulder subluxation during transfers | Over-stimulation causing shutdown | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Conversations about alcohol | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks
