- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Safeguarding plan in place for disclosures
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Physio reviews positioning plan monthly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Conversations about alcohol | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Shoulder subluxation during transfers | Poor positioning leading to pain | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
