## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Unexpected touch from behind | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation | Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Constipation increasing confusion | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
