## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Poor positioning leading to pain
- Footwear rubbing or slipping
- High-sugar snacks left in communal areas
- Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction
- Delayed meals
- Infections leading to hyperglycaemia

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Hypoglycaemia during night
- Depression linked to communication barriers
- Pressure damage over sacrum
- Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**

- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions
- OT checks splints quarterly
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation | Large groups or overlapping conversations | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | Delayed meals | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes
- Family update log maintained weekly
- Repositioning chart maintained
- Weekly skin inspections

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
