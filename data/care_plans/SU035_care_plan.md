## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**

- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues
- Offer high-calorie small meals

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Dietitian monitors weight monthly
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Delayed meals | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Dusty environments | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Muscle rigidity leading to pain | Rapid positional changes causing dizziness | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Missed lactulose doses | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
