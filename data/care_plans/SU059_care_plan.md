## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy | Baseline saturation 92%; productive cough in mornings. | Weight monthly / Linked team: Respiratory Nurse |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema | Requires leg elevation in recliner, fluid restriction 1500ml/day. | Fluid balance tallied each shift / Linked team: Community Heart Failure Nurse |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy | Requires foot inspections and carbohydrate counting support. | Weekly foot integrity log / Linked team: Pain Clinic |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning | Requires 24-hour supervision, repetitive questioning, exit-seeking after 17:00. | ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes / Linked team: Memory clinic consultant |

**Professional network actively involved:** Respiratory Nurse, Physiotherapist, Dietitian, Community Heart Failure Nurse, GP, Diabetes Specialist Nurse, Podiatry, Pain Clinic, Memory clinic consultant, Admiral Nurse

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Infections leading to hyperglycaemia
- High-sugar snacks left in communal areas
- Large groups or overlapping conversations
- Anxiety causing rapid breathing
- Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation
- Pain or discomfort not verbalised

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Hypoglycaemia during night
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively
- Risk of missing medication due to confusion
- Skin breakdown over ankles

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Uses reminiscence playlist while carers complete dressing to reduce anxiety.
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.
- May nap after lunch; ensure heels are offloaded and oxygen concentrator checked.

### Evening & Night
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Footwear rubbing or slipping | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Dizziness when diuretics peak | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Weight loss due to breathlessness eating | Missing nebuliser treatment | Increase observation frequency during infection |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation | Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily
- Weight monthly
- Nebuliser maintenance log
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
