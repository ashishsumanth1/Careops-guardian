## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Allow extra time for verbal responses
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Sensory overload in dining room | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Delayed Parkinson's medication | If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | Report any new weakness immediately |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
- Safeguarding notes kept confidentially
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly
- Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
