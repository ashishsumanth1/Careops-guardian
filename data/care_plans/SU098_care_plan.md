- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- Report any new weakness immediately

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months
- OT checks splints quarterly
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends
- Admiral nurse provides monthly coaching to staff

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Isolation if peers misunderstand communication | Staff speaking over each other | Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | High-salt meals | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Large groups or overlapping conversations | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Over-stimulation causing shutdown | For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Missing nebuliser treatment | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- Repositioning chart maintained
- Weekly skin inspections

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.
