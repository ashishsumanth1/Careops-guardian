| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Fatigue following physiotherapy | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |

**Escalation reminders:**
