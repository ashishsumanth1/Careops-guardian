## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues | Requires structured prompts, risk of confabulation, takes lactulose. | Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness / Linked team: Psych liaison |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy | Requires foot inspections and carbohydrate counting support. | Pain score recorded twice daily / Linked team: Diabetes Specialist Nurse |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy | Baseline saturation 92%; productive cough in mornings. | Nebuliser maintenance log / Linked team: Respiratory Nurse |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability | Communicates with short phrases, uses tablet for choice boards. | Sensory regulation log / Linked team: Psychiatrist |

**Professional network actively involved:** Hepatology clinic, Dietitian, Psych liaison, Diabetes Specialist Nurse, Podiatry, Pain Clinic, Respiratory Nurse, Physiotherapist, Learning Disability Nurse, Psychiatrist

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Missing nebuliser treatment
- Conversations about alcohol
- High-sugar snacks left in communal areas
- Sensory overload in dining room
- Delayed meals
- Staff speaking over each other

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Hypoglycaemia during night
- Isolation if peers misunderstand communication
- Foot ulceration
- CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription
- Hepatic encephalopathy

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.
- Wake between 06:30-07:00; offer warm lemon water before personal care.

### Daytime
- May nap after lunch; ensure heels are offloaded and oxygen concentrator checked.
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.

### Evening & Night
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Offer sensory diet (deep pressure, weighted lap pad)

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed
- Increase observation frequency during infection

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- Learning disability nurse provides quarterly review
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months
- Dietitian monitors weight monthly
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | High-sugar snacks left in communal areas | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Strong smells in dining room | Allow recovery time without demands |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Sensory overload in dining room | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening
- Weekly foot integrity log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
