## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Allow extra time for verbal responses
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- Allow recovery time without demands
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated
- SALT monitors swallowing competence

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Dusty environments | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Male voices shouting | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Missed lactulose doses | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Unexpected schedule changes | Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Muscle rigidity leading to pain | Delayed Parkinson's medication | Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
- Safeguarding notes kept confidentially

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.
