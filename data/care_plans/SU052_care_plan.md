## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Constipation increasing confusion | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Fatigue following physiotherapy | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | Footwear rubbing or slipping | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes
- Family update log maintained weekly
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening
- Weekly foot integrity log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks
