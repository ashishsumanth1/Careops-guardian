## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy | Baseline saturation 92%; productive cough in mornings. | Weight monthly / Linked team: Respiratory Nurse |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning | Requires 24-hour supervision, repetitive questioning, exit-seeking after 17:00. | Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00 / Linked team: Memory clinic consultant |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity | Requires full hoist transfers, bespoke seating, and passive physiotherapy. | Repositioning chart maintained / Linked team: Occupational Therapist |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension | Transfers require two staff with Sara Stedy, experiences freezing episodes each morning. | Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents / Linked team: Physiotherapist |

**Professional network actively involved:** Respiratory Nurse, Physiotherapist, Dietitian, Memory clinic consultant, Admiral Nurse, Occupational Therapist, Neurology clinic, SALT

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Constipation increasing tone
- Thin fluids leading to coughing
- Poor positioning leading to pain
- Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction
- Over-stimulation causing shutdown
- Large groups or overlapping conversations

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Aspiration during meals
- CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating
- Shoulder subluxation during transfers
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Wake between 06:30-07:00; offer warm lemon water before personal care.
- Accepts strip wash in bathroom if preferred staff present; otherwise, offer basin wash in-room.

### Daytime
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.

### Evening & Night
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30
- Allow extra time for verbal responses

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- Increase observation frequency during infection
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- Admiral nurse provides monthly coaching to staff
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Large groups or overlapping conversations | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Delayed Parkinson's medication | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily
- Weight monthly
- Nebuliser maintenance log
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
