## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues | Requires structured prompts, risk of confabulation, takes lactulose. | Exit-seeking log / Linked team: Psych liaison |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema | Requires leg elevation in recliner, fluid restriction 1500ml/day. | Ankle girth measured twice weekly / Linked team: GP |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension | Transfers require two staff with Sara Stedy, experiences freezing episodes each morning. | Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents / Linked team: Neurology clinic |

**Professional network actively involved:** Hepatology clinic, Dietitian, Psych liaison, Community Heart Failure Nurse, GP, Neurology clinic, SALT, Physiotherapist

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Missed diuretics
- Constipation increasing confusion
- Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation
- High-salt meals
- Emotional distress increasing heart rate
- Thin fluids leading to coughing

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Muscle rigidity leading to pain
- Aspiration during meals
- Hepatic encephalopathy
- Syncope due to blood pressure drops
- Exit seeking and community disorientation

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Uses reminiscence playlist while carers complete dressing to reduce anxiety.
- Breakfast best served in dining room window seat with porridge and stewed fruit.

### Daytime
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.

### Evening & Night
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed
- Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Thin fluids leading to coughing | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Missed lactulose doses | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
