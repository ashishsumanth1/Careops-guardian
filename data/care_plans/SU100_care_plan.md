## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Offer sensory diet (deep pressure, weighted lap pad)
- Provide visual timetable updated each shift
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room
- Increase observation frequency during infection
- Allow recovery time without demands

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Family advocate involved in best-interest meetings
- Psychiatrist oversees medication annually
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- Dietitian monitors weight monthly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Missed lactulose doses | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Clothing labels causing itch | Allow recovery time without demands |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Chest infections | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Sensory regulation log
- Food intake chart when new menu trialled
- Incident review template
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily
- Weight monthly

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
