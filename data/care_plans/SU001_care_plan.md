## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Infections leading to hyperglycaemia
- Chest infections
- Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation
- Dusty environments
- Missing nebuliser treatment
- Smell of disinfectant similar to past events

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Foot ulceration
- Flash pulmonary oedema
- Suicidal ideation (historical)
- Heightened anxiety leading to aggression
- Hypoglycaemia during night

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.
- Wake between 06:30-07:00; offer warm lemon water before personal care.

### Daytime
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.

### Evening & Night
- If restless, offer folded laundry task or memory box to redirect energy.
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | High-salt meals | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Foot ulceration | Delayed meals | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Chest infections | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Nightmares leading to disorientation | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
- Safeguarding notes kept confidentially
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
