## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated
- Safeguarding plan in place for disclosures

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Constipation increasing confusion | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Thin fluids leading to coughing | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Male voices shouting | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.
