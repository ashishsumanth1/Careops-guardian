**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Conversations about alcohol | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Nightmares leading to disorientation | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | Footwear rubbing or slipping | If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
