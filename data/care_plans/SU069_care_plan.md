## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Acute exacerbation requiring hospital | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Nightmares leading to disorientation | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Missed diuretics | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Delayed meals | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
