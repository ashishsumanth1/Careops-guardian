|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Conversations about alcohol | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
