- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- May nap after lunch; ensure heels are offloaded and oxygen concentrator checked.
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.

### Evening & Night
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Strict fluid balance sheet

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- Increase observation frequency during infection
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Dietitian monitors weight monthly
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Nightmares leading to disorientation | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Foot ulceration | High-sugar snacks left in communal areas | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Acute exacerbation requiring hospital | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | Increase observation frequency during infection |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
- Safeguarding notes kept confidentially
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
