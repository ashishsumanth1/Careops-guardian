## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Sensory overload in dining room | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
