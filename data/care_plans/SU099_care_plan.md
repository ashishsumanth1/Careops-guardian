## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Sensory overload in dining room
- Missed lactulose doses
- Emotional distress increasing heart rate
- Unexpected touch from behind
- Conversations about alcohol
- Nightmares leading to disorientation

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Pressure damage over sacrum
- Dizziness when diuretics peak
- Flash pulmonary oedema
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Accepts strip wash in bathroom if preferred staff present; otherwise, offer basin wash in-room.
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.

### Evening & Night
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- Increase observation frequency during infection
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- OT checks splints quarterly
- Dietitian monitors weight monthly
- Safeguarding plan in place for disclosures

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Unexpected touch from behind | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Dizziness when diuretics peak | Missed diuretics | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Acute exacerbation requiring hospital | Missing nebuliser treatment | Increase observation frequency during infection |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Sensory overload in dining room | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Shoulder subluxation during transfers | Constipation increasing tone | For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
- Safeguarding notes kept confidentially
- Repositioning chart maintained
- Weekly skin inspections

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
