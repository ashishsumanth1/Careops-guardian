## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Footwear rubbing or slipping
- Infections leading to hyperglycaemia
- Pain or discomfort not verbalised
- Delayed meals
- Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking
- High-sugar snacks left in communal areas

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Skin breakdown over ankles
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively
- Dizziness when diuretics peak
- Foot ulceration
- Risk of missing medication due to confusion

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Ensure podiatry-approved footwear only
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Foot ulceration | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
