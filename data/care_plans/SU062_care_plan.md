## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Dusty environments
- Unexpected touch from behind
- Male voices shouting
- Clothing labels causing itch
- Nightmares leading to disorientation
- Anxiety causing rapid breathing

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating
- Suicidal ideation (historical)
- Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations
- Acute exacerbation requiring hospital
- Aspiration during meals

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

---

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.
- Uses reminiscence playlist while carers complete dressing to reduce anxiety.

### Daytime
- Risk of distress if communal TV is loud; offer headphones or quiet lounge alternative.
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.

### Evening & Night
- If restless, offer folded laundry task or memory box to redirect energy.
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Ensure podiatry-approved footwear only
- Allow extra time for verbal responses
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- Allow recovery time without demands

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Dietitian monitors weight monthly
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- Family advocate involved in best-interest meetings
- SALT monitors swallowing competence

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Missing nebuliser treatment | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Muscle rigidity leading to pain | Delayed Parkinson's medication | If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Unexpected schedule changes | Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Delayed meals | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Male voices shouting | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening
- Weekly foot integrity log
- Pain score recorded twice daily
- Sensory regulation log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
