## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Poor positioning leading to pain
- Rapid positional changes causing dizziness
- Thin fluids leading to coughing
- Pain or discomfort not verbalised
- Clothing labels causing itch
- Constipation increasing tone

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Meltdowns leading to self-injury
- Syncope due to blood pressure drops
- Isolation if peers misunderstand communication
- Risk of missing medication due to confusion
- Depression linked to communication barriers

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

---

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Breakfast best served in dining room window seat with porridge and stewed fruit.
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.

### Evening & Night
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Provide visual timetable updated each shift
- Use tablet-based social stories before appointments
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers
- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities
- Use sling specified by physio only

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques
- Report any new weakness immediately
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Learning disability nurse provides quarterly review
- OT checks splints quarterly
- Psychiatrist oversees medication annually
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Muscle rigidity leading to pain | Delayed Parkinson's medication | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Unexpected schedule changes | Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Poor positioning leading to pain | If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes
- Family update log maintained weekly
- Repositioning chart maintained
- Weekly skin inspections
- Mood log linked to therapy engagement

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
