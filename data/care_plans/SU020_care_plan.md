| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues | Requires structured prompts, risk of confabulation, takes lactulose. | Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness / Linked team: Psych liaison |

**Professional network actively involved:** Diabetes Specialist Nurse, Podiatry, Pain Clinic, Neurology clinic, SALT, Physiotherapist, Hepatology clinic, Dietitian, Psych liaison

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Footwear rubbing or slipping
- Thin fluids leading to coughing
- Delayed Parkinson's medication
- Sensory overload in dining room
- Missed lactulose doses
- Delayed meals

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Verbal aggression when challenged
- Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations
- Hepatic encephalopathy
- Exit seeking and community disorientation
- Foot ulceration

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Breakfast best served in dining room window seat with porridge and stewed fruit.
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- May nap after lunch; ensure heels are offloaded and oxygen concentrator checked.
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.

### Evening & Night
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids
- Allow extra time for verbal responses

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Missed lactulose doses | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Fatigue following physiotherapy | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Foot ulceration | High-sugar snacks left in communal areas | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening
- Weekly foot integrity log
- Pain score recorded twice daily
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
