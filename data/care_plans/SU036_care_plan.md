|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy | Baseline saturation 92%; productive cough in mornings. | Weight monthly / Linked team: Physiotherapist |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension | Transfers require two staff with Sara Stedy, experiences freezing episodes each morning. | Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents / Linked team: Physiotherapist |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning | Requires 24-hour supervision, repetitive questioning, exit-seeking after 17:00. | ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes / Linked team: Admiral Nurse |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression | May decline care, experiences nightmares, hypervigilant to loud voices. | Safeguarding notes kept confidentially / Linked team: Community Mental Health Team |

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Smell of disinfectant similar to past events
- Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking
- Fatigue following physiotherapy
- Nightmares leading to disorientation
- Chest infections
- Missing nebuliser treatment

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Syncope due to blood pressure drops
- Muscle rigidity leading to pain
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation
- Suicidal ideation (historical)
- Aspiration during meals

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Breakfast best served in dining room window seat with porridge and stewed fruit.
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- Risk of distress if communal TV is loud; offer headphones or quiet lounge alternative.
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.

### Evening & Night
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Dietitian monitors weight monthly
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- SALT monitors swallowing competence

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Large groups or overlapping conversations | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Male voices shouting | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Weight loss due to breathlessness eating | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Muscle rigidity leading to pain | Thin fluids leading to coughing | Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily
- Weight monthly
- Nebuliser maintenance log
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly
- Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
