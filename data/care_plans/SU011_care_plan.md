## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Clothing labels causing itch
- Fatigue following physiotherapy
- Missed lactulose doses
- Strong smells in dining room
- Delayed Parkinson's medication
- Unexpected schedule changes

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Meltdowns leading to self-injury
- Shoulder subluxation during transfers
- Hepatic encephalopathy
- Muscle rigidity leading to pain
- Foot ulceration

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Wake between 06:30-07:00; offer warm lemon water before personal care.
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.
- Risk of distress if communal TV is loud; offer headphones or quiet lounge alternative.

### Evening & Night
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Ensure podiatry-approved footwear only
- Use tablet-based social stories before appointments
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- OT checks splints quarterly
- Family advocate involved in best-interest meetings
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- Physio reviews positioning plan monthly
- Psychiatrist oversees medication annually

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Conversations about alcohol | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Shoulder subluxation during transfers | Poor positioning leading to pain | For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Delayed Parkinson's medication | Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Strong smells in dining room | Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Repositioning chart maintained
- Weekly skin inspections
- Mood log linked to therapy engagement
- Sensory regulation log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
