## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Sensory overload in dining room
- High-sugar snacks left in communal areas

- Poor positioning leading to pain
- Missed lactulose doses

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Exit seeking and community disorientation
- Depression linked to communication barriers

- Flash pulmonary oedema

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**

- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.

### Evening & Night
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.
- If restless, offer folded laundry task or memory box to redirect energy.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- OT checks splints quarterly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Constipation increasing tone | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Constipation increasing confusion | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | High-sugar snacks left in communal areas | If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening
- Weekly foot integrity log
- Pain score recorded twice daily
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
