## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Unexpected schedule changes
- High-salt meals
- Emotional distress increasing heart rate
- Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction
- Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation
- Large groups or overlapping conversations

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Dizziness when diuretics peak
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation
- Skin breakdown over ankles
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively
- Isolation if peers misunderstand communication

### Daytime
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.

### Evening & Night
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Provide visual timetable updated each shift
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech
- Allow recovery time without demands
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Learning disability nurse provides quarterly review
- Family advocate involved in best-interest meetings
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Admiral nurse provides monthly coaching to staff

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Meltdowns leading to self-injury | Strong smells in dining room | Allow recovery time without demands |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
