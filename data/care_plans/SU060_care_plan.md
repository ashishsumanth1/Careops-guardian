- Ensure podiatry-approved footwear only
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Learning disability nurse provides quarterly review
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Dizziness when diuretics peak | High-salt meals | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | Delayed meals | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Thin fluids leading to coughing | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Isolation if peers misunderstand communication | Unexpected schedule changes | Allow recovery time without demands |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

- Weekly foot integrity log
- Pain score recorded twice daily
- Sensory regulation log
- Food intake chart when new menu trialled
- Incident review template
