**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation
- Footwear rubbing or slipping
- Sensory overload in dining room
- High-sugar snacks left in communal areas
- Constipation increasing confusion
- Emotional distress increasing heart rate

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Skin breakdown over ankles
- Foot ulceration
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

- Breakfast best served in dining room window seat with porridge and stewed fruit.

### Daytime
- May nap after lunch; ensure heels are offloaded and oxygen concentrator checked.
- Risk of distress if communal TV is loud; offer headphones or quiet lounge alternative.

### Evening & Night
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- Increase observation frequency during infection
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Footwear rubbing or slipping | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Large groups or overlapping conversations | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Dusty environments | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Dizziness when diuretics peak | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Sensory overload in dining room | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily
- Weight monthly
