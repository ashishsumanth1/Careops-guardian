## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30
- Ensure podiatry-approved footwear only
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Allow extra time for verbal responses

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Male voices shouting | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Thin fluids leading to coughing | If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening
- Weekly foot integrity log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
