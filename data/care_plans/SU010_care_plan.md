## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Admiral nurse provides monthly coaching to staff

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Delayed meals | If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Large groups or overlapping conversations | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Sensory overload in dining room | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening
- Weekly foot integrity log
- Pain score recorded twice daily

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
