## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema | Requires leg elevation in recliner, fluid restriction 1500ml/day. | Daily weights logged / Linked team: Community Heart Failure Nurse |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension | Transfers require two staff with Sara Stedy, experiences freezing episodes each morning. | Record BP lying and standing twice weekly / Linked team: Neurology clinic |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues | Requires structured prompts, risk of confabulation, takes lactulose. | Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness / Linked team: Psych liaison |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression | May decline care, experiences nightmares, hypervigilant to loud voices. | Weekly MDT reflection on triggers / Linked team: Community Mental Health Team |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy | Baseline saturation 92%; productive cough in mornings. | SATS and respiratory rate twice daily / Linked team: Respiratory Nurse |

**Professional network actively involved:** Community Heart Failure Nurse, GP, Neurology clinic, SALT, Physiotherapist, Hepatology clinic, Dietitian, Psych liaison, Community Mental Health Team, Psychologist, Respiratory Nurse

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Chest infections
- Fatigue following physiotherapy
- Missing nebuliser treatment
- Smell of disinfectant similar to past events
- Thin fluids leading to coughing
- Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Skin breakdown over ankles
- CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription
- Muscle rigidity leading to pain
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating
- Acute exacerbation requiring hospital

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Wake between 06:30-07:00; offer warm lemon water before personal care.
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- Risk of distress if communal TV is loud; offer headphones or quiet lounge alternative.
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.

### Evening & Night
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Allow extra time for verbal responses
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- CMHT reviews antidepressant therapy bi-monthly
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Conversations about alcohol | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | High-salt meals | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Acute exacerbation requiring hospital | Chest infections | Increase observation frequency during infection |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Rapid positional changes causing dizziness | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly
- Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
