## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Isolation if peers misunderstand communication | Staff speaking over each other | Allow recovery time without demands |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation | Large groups or overlapping conversations | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Missed lactulose doses | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Foot ulceration | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
