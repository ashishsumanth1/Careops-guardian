## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Anxiety causing rapid breathing
- Sensory overload in dining room
- Conversations about alcohol
- Missed lactulose doses
- Missing nebuliser treatment
- Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Muscle rigidity leading to pain
- Risk of missing medication due to confusion
- Acute exacerbation requiring hospital
- Heightened anxiety leading to aggression
- Aspiration during meals

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Wake between 06:30-07:00; offer warm lemon water before personal care.
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.

### Evening & Night
- If restless, offer folded laundry task or memory box to redirect energy.
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Admiral nurse provides monthly coaching to staff
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Weight loss due to breathlessness eating | Dusty environments | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Constipation increasing confusion | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Delayed Parkinson's medication | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation | Large groups or overlapping conversations | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes
- Family update log maintained weekly
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
