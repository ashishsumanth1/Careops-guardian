## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- High-sugar snacks left in communal areas
- Anxiety causing rapid breathing
- Dusty environments
- High-salt meals
- Fatigue after 30 minutes upright
- Chest infections

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Dizziness when diuretics peak
- Depression linked to communication barriers
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation
- Risk of missing medication due to confusion

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Medication window 07:30-08:00; crush tablets only if SALT guidance permits.
- Wake between 06:30-07:00; offer warm lemon water before personal care.

### Daytime
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.
- Risk of distress if communal TV is loud; offer headphones or quiet lounge alternative.

### Evening & Night
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Ensure podiatry-approved footwear only
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- Increase observation frequency during infection
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- OT checks splints quarterly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Acute exacerbation requiring hospital | Dusty environments | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | Delayed meals | If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | High-salt meals | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening
- Weekly foot integrity log
- Pain score recorded twice daily
- Daily weights logged

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
