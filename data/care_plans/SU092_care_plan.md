## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues | Requires structured prompts, risk of confabulation, takes lactulose. | Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness / Linked team: Dietitian |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning | Requires 24-hour supervision, repetitive questioning, exit-seeking after 17:00. | ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes / Linked team: Memory clinic consultant |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity | Requires full hoist transfers, bespoke seating, and passive physiotherapy. | Weekly skin inspections / Linked team: Occupational Therapist |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension | Transfers require two staff with Sara Stedy, experiences freezing episodes each morning. | Daily Parkinson's symptom log / Linked team: Physiotherapist |

**Professional network actively involved:** Hepatology clinic, Dietitian, Psych liaison, Memory clinic consultant, Admiral Nurse, Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist, Neurology clinic, SALT

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Sensory overload in dining room
- Delayed Parkinson's medication
- Constipation increasing confusion
- Missed lactulose doses
- Fatigue following physiotherapy
- Over-stimulation causing shutdown

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Risk of missing medication due to confusion
- Hepatic encephalopathy
- Shoulder subluxation during transfers
- Verbal aggression when challenged
- Muscle rigidity leading to pain

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Breakfast best served in dining room window seat with porridge and stewed fruit.
- Medication window 07:30-08:00; crush tablets only if SALT guidance permits.

### Daytime
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.

### Evening & Night
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months
- OT checks splints quarterly
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Constipation increasing confusion | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Constipation increasing tone | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Delayed Parkinson's medication | Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
