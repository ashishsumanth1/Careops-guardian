## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Large groups or overlapping conversations
- Unexpected touch from behind
- Constipation increasing confusion

- High-sugar snacks left in communal areas

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Exit seeking and community disorientation
- Hypoglycaemia during night
- Acute exacerbation requiring hospital
- Heightened anxiety leading to aggression

- May nap after lunch; ensure heels are offloaded and oxygen concentrator checked.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence
- Increase observation frequency during infection

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- Dietitian monitors weight monthly
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Chest infections | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Conversations about alcohol | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Large groups or overlapping conversations | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Unexpected touch from behind | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
