## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Fatigue following physiotherapy
- Unexpected touch from behind

- Male voices shouting

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Verbal aggression when challenged
- Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash)

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.
- Medication window 07:30-08:00; crush tablets only if SALT guidance permits.

### Daytime
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.

### Evening & Night
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Allow extra time for verbal responses
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- CMHT reviews antidepressant therapy bi-monthly
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- Safeguarding plan in place for disclosures

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Constipation increasing confusion | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Delayed Parkinson's medication | Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Unexpected touch from behind | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly
- Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents
- Daily Parkinson's symptom log
- Daily mood tracker

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

---

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
