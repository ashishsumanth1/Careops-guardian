| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability | Communicates with short phrases, uses tablet for choice boards. | Food intake chart when new menu trialled / Linked team: Psychiatrist |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity | Requires full hoist transfers, bespoke seating, and passive physiotherapy. | Weekly skin inspections / Linked team: Occupational Therapist |

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Dusty environments
- Fatigue after 30 minutes upright
- Clothing labels causing itch
- Smell of disinfectant similar to past events
- Emotional distress increasing heart rate
- Constipation increasing tone

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Suicidal ideation (historical)
- Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash)
- Shoulder subluxation during transfers
- Meltdowns leading to self-injury
- Food refusal if textures disliked

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Breakfast best served in dining room window seat with porridge and stewed fruit.
- Medication window 07:30-08:00; crush tablets only if SALT guidance permits.

### Daytime
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.

### Evening & Night
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Provide visual timetable updated each shift
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing
- Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Psychiatrist oversees medication annually
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected
- Learning disability nurse provides quarterly review

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Constipation increasing tone | For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Isolation if peers misunderstand communication | Strong smells in dining room | Allow recovery time without demands |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Weight loss due to breathlessness eating | Dusty environments | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily
- Weight monthly

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
