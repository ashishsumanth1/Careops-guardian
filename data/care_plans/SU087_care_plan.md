### Daytime
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.

### Evening & Night
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- Safeguarding plan in place for disclosures
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Fatigue following physiotherapy | If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Acute exacerbation requiring hospital | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
- Safeguarding notes kept confidentially
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly
- Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
