## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Provide visual timetable updated each shift

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Diabetes nurse reviews insulin regime quarterly
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Muscle rigidity leading to pain | Delayed Parkinson's medication | Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Constipation increasing confusion | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Isolation if peers misunderstand communication | Strong smells in dining room | Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Male voices shouting | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Sensory regulation log
- Food intake chart when new menu trialled
- Incident review template
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
- Safeguarding notes kept confidentially

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).
