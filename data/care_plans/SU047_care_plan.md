- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Provide structured day planner with traffic-light cues
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Conversations about alcohol | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Poor positioning leading to pain | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Rapid positional changes causing dizziness | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
