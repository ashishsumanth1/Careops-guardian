## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Teach staff to record carb portions
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Ensure podiatry-approved footwear only

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- OT checks splints quarterly
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Constipation increasing confusion | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Dusty environments | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Footwear rubbing or slipping | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
