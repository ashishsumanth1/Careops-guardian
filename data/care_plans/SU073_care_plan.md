- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- Report any new weakness immediately
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- CMHT reviews antidepressant therapy bi-monthly
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Conversations about alcohol | Use clear, factual statements and do not argue |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | High-salt meals | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Male voices shouting | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Shoulder subluxation during transfers | Poor positioning leading to pain | If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
- Safeguarding notes kept confidentially
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
