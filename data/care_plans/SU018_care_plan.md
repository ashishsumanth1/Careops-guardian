- Poor positioning leading to pain

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash)
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating
- Pressure damage over sacrum

- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Implement 2-hourly repositioning schedule

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Report any new weakness immediately
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- Increase observation frequency during infection
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- Physio reviews positioning plan monthly
- Dietitian monitors weight monthly
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated
- CMHT reviews antidepressant therapy bi-monthly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Over-stimulation causing shutdown | For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
- Safeguarding notes kept confidentially
- Repositioning chart maintained
- Weekly skin inspections

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
