- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated
- CMHT reviews antidepressant therapy bi-monthly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Conversations about alcohol | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Unexpected touch from behind | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
