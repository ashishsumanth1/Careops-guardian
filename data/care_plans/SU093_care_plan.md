## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning | Requires 24-hour supervision, repetitive questioning, exit-seeking after 17:00. | ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes / Linked team: Memory clinic consultant |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy | Baseline saturation 92%; productive cough in mornings. | Nebuliser maintenance log / Linked team: Respiratory Nurse |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema | Requires leg elevation in recliner, fluid restriction 1500ml/day. | Ankle girth measured twice weekly / Linked team: GP |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension | Transfers require two staff with Sara Stedy, experiences freezing episodes each morning. | Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents / Linked team: Physiotherapist |

**Professional network actively involved:** Memory clinic consultant, Admiral Nurse, Respiratory Nurse, Physiotherapist, Dietitian, Community Heart Failure Nurse, GP, Neurology clinic, SALT

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Missing nebuliser treatment
- Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction
- Chest infections
- Rapid positional changes causing dizziness
- Emotional distress increasing heart rate
- Anxiety causing rapid breathing

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively
- Syncope due to blood pressure drops
- CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription
- Dizziness when diuretics peak
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Accepts strip wash in bathroom if preferred staff present; otherwise, offer basin wash in-room.
- Breakfast best served in dining room window seat with porridge and stewed fruit.

### Daytime
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.

### Evening & Night
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Allow extra time for verbal responses
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids
- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Weight loss due to breathlessness eating | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Delayed Parkinson's medication | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Missed diuretics | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes
- Family update log maintained weekly
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily
- Weight monthly

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
