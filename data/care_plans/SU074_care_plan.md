## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction
- Chest infections
- Unexpected schedule changes
- Anxiety causing rapid breathing
- Staff speaking over each other
- Dusty environments

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively
- Risk of missing medication due to confusion
- CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**

- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Meltdowns leading to self-injury | Staff speaking over each other | Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Acute exacerbation requiring hospital | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily
- Weight monthly
- Nebuliser maintenance log
- Sensory regulation log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
