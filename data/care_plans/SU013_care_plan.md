## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Large groups or overlapping conversations
- Over-stimulation causing shutdown
- Chest infections
- Pain or discomfort not verbalised
- Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking
- Anxiety causing rapid breathing

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation
- Pressure damage over sacrum
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating
- Acute exacerbation requiring hospital
- Shoulder subluxation during transfers

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Uses reminiscence playlist while carers complete dressing to reduce anxiety.
- Accepts strip wash in bathroom if preferred staff present; otherwise, offer basin wash in-room.

### Daytime
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.

### Evening & Night
- Sleep more settled with weighted blanket and familiar radio station at low volume.
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Provide communication board and allow time

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence
- Increase observation frequency during infection
- Report any new weakness immediately
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Physio reviews positioning plan monthly
- OT checks splints quarterly
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Chest infections | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Constipation increasing tone | If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes
- Family update log maintained weekly
- Repositioning chart maintained
- Weekly skin inspections

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
