## Clinical Overview

| Condition | Presentation | Monitoring / Clinician Link |

| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy | Baseline saturation 92%; productive cough in mornings. | Nebuliser maintenance log / Linked team: Respiratory Nurse |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression | May decline care, experiences nightmares, hypervigilant to loud voices. | Safeguarding notes kept confidentially / Linked team: Psychologist |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning | Requires 24-hour supervision, repetitive questioning, exit-seeking after 17:00. | ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes / Linked team: Memory clinic consultant |

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Emotional distress increasing heart rate
- Anxiety causing rapid breathing
- Unexpected touch from behind
- Nightmares leading to disorientation
- Dusty environments
- Extended periods in wheelchair without elevation

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Skin breakdown over ankles
- Heightened anxiety leading to aggression
- Dizziness when diuretics peak
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Accepts strip wash in bathroom if preferred staff present; otherwise, offer basin wash in-room.
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.

### Daytime
- Risk of distress if communal TV is loud; offer headphones or quiet lounge alternative.
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.

### Evening & Night
- If restless, offer folded laundry task or memory box to redirect energy.
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Nightmares leading to disorientation | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Acute exacerbation requiring hospital | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | Increase observation frequency during infection |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Dizziness when diuretics peak | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily weights logged
- Fluid balance tallied each shift
- Ankle girth measured twice weekly
- SATS and respiratory rate twice daily

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
