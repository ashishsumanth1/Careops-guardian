## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Use sling specified by physio only

- Provide communication board and allow time
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- Report any new weakness immediately

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- GP monitors antispasmodic medication
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises

|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Over-stimulation causing shutdown | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Large groups or overlapping conversations | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Sensory overload in dining room | Offer quiet space and weighted blanket |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Male voices shouting | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |
