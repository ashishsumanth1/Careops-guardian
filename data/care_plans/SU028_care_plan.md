- Constipation increasing tone

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively
- Risk of missing medication due to confusion
- Flash pulmonary oedema
- Skin breakdown over ankles

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.
- Accepts strip wash in bathroom if preferred staff present; otherwise, offer basin wash in-room.

### Daytime
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.

### Evening & Night
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.
- If restless, offer folded laundry task or memory box to redirect energy.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Report any new weakness immediately
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- Report redness on feet immediately and photograph

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- GP provides rescue steroid/antibiotic packs
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months
- Podiatry visit every 6 weeks
- Physio reviews positioning plan monthly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Large groups or overlapping conversations | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Fatigue after 30 minutes upright | Report any new weakness immediately |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Weight loss due to breathlessness eating | Dusty environments | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes
- Family update log maintained weekly
- Daily weights logged

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
