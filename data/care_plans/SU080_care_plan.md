## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.
- Wake between 06:30-07:00; offer warm lemon water before personal care.

### Daytime
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.

### Evening & Night
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Maintain orientation board with date, staff photos, and planned activities
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- Safeguarding plan in place for disclosures
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- CMHT reviews antidepressant therapy bi-monthly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Missed lactulose doses | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Daily mood tracker
- Weekly MDT reflection on triggers
- Safeguarding notes kept confidentially
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
