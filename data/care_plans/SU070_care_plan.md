- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed
- Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech
- Report weight gain >2kg in 3 days to heart failure nurse
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Staff speaking over each other | Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Missed diuretics | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

- Sensory regulation log
- Food intake chart when new menu trialled
- Incident review template
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
