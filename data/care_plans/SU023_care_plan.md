## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Rapid positional changes causing dizziness
- Strong smells in dining room
- Poor positioning leading to pain
- Unexpected schedule changes
- Staff speaking over each other
- Sensory overload in dining room

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Food refusal if textures disliked
- Depression linked to communication barriers
- Hepatic encephalopathy
- Verbal aggression when challenged
- Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash)

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.

---

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.
- Medication window 07:30-08:00; crush tablets only if SALT guidance permits.

### Daytime
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.
- Risk of distress if communal TV is loud; offer headphones or quiet lounge alternative.

### Evening & Night
- If restless, offer folded laundry task or memory box to redirect energy.
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids
- Use tablet-based social stories before appointments
- Assign keyworker for reality orientation
- Encourage hydration and lactulose adherence
- Provide visual timetable updated each shift
- Allow extra time for verbal responses

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint
- For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Psychologist offers remote sessions when tolerated
- Dietitian supports low-protein evening snack
- Safeguarding plan in place for disclosures
- CMHT reviews antidepressant therapy bi-monthly
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Delayed Parkinson's medication | Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Depression linked to communication barriers | Constipation increasing tone | Report any new weakness immediately |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Exit seeking and community disorientation | Missed lactulose doses | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Nightmares leading to disorientation | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Strong smells in dining room | Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Sensory regulation log
- Food intake chart when new menu trialled
- Incident review template
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
