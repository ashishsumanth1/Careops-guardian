## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles
- Provide visual timetable updated each shift
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Provide communication board and allow time
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech
- Report any new weakness immediately
- If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- Neurology team reviews regimen every 6 months
- Family advocate involved in best-interest meetings
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- OT checks splints quarterly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Aspiration during meals | Thin fluids leading to coughing | Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Self-neglect (refusal to eat or wash) | Nightmares leading to disorientation | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Constipation increasing tone | If tone increases, apply heat pack per protocol and consult physio |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Unexpected schedule changes | Allow recovery time without demands |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.
