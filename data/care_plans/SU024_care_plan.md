- Offer sensory diet (deep pressure, weighted lap pad)
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP
- Allow recovery time without demands

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Admiral nurse provides monthly coaching to staff
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- Learning disability nurse provides quarterly review

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Meltdowns leading to self-injury | Strong smells in dining room | Allow recovery time without demands |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Muscle rigidity leading to pain | Rapid positional changes causing dizziness | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Sensory overload in dining room | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Sensory regulation log
- Food intake chart when new menu trialled
- Incident review template
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
