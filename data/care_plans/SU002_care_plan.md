## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Hypoglycaemia during night | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Pressure damage over sacrum | Poor positioning leading to pain | Report any new weakness immediately |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - Weight loss due to breathlessness eating | Missing nebuliser treatment | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- Escalate to Registered Nurse, complete SBARD handover, and contact GP out-of-hours if pain unmanaged within 2 hours.
