## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Over-stimulation causing shutdown
- Missing nebuliser treatment
- Conversations about alcohol

- Sensory overload in dining room
- Nightmares leading to disorientation

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Weight loss due to breathlessness eating
- Acute exacerbation requiring hospital
- Suicidal ideation (historical)
- Shoulder subluxation during transfers
- Exit seeking and community disorientation

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.

- Wake between 06:30-07:00; offer warm lemon water before personal care.

### Daytime
- May nap after lunch; ensure heels are offloaded and oxygen concentrator checked.
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.

### Evening & Night
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Ensure nebuliser cleaned and ready twice daily
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Use sling specified by physio only
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Offer high-calorie small meals
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions
- Use clear, factual statements and do not argue
- If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Hepatology clinic reviews bloods quarterly
- Dietitian monitors weight monthly
- Safeguarding plan in place for disclosures
- Psych liaison available if relapse risk rises
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Verbal aggression when challenged | Sensory overload in dining room | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Nightmares leading to disorientation | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Post-stroke hemiplegia with spasticity - Shoulder subluxation during transfers | Poor positioning leading to pain | For mood decline, use supported conversation techniques |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Chest infections | For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Bowel chart for lactulose effectiveness
- Weekly LFT trend recording (if available)
- Exit-seeking log
- Repositioning chart maintained
- Weekly skin inspections
- Mood log linked to therapy engagement

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
