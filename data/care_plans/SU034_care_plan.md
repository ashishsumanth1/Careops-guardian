**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse

- Offer quiet space and weighted blanket
- Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room
- For hypo signs, follow fast-acting glucose protocol

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Unexpected touch from behind | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Delayed Parkinson's medication | If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse |
| Alcohol-related brain damage with hepatic issues - Hepatic encephalopathy | Conversations about alcohol | If hepatic signs emerge, escalate to GP |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Meltdowns leading to self-injury | Strong smells in dining room | Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
