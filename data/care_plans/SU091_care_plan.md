## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Isolation if peers misunderstand communication | Unexpected schedule changes | Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Foot ulceration | Infections leading to hyperglycaemia | If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Smell of disinfectant similar to past events | Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- If behaviours escalate beyond verbal de-escalation, call senior on duty, consider PRN per protocol, and log on ABC chart.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Blood glucose before breakfast and evening
- Weekly foot integrity log
- Pain score recorded twice daily
- Sensory regulation log

**Documentation expectations:**

4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
