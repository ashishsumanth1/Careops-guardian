## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Strong smells in dining room
- Large groups or overlapping conversations
- High-salt meals
- Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking
- Unexpected schedule changes
- Missed diuretics

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Food refusal if textures disliked
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation
- Dizziness when diuretics peak
- Meltdowns leading to self-injury

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Transfers using Sara Stedy with two staff; ensure orthostatic BP observed prior to standing.
- Medication window 07:30-08:00; crush tablets only if SALT guidance permits.

### Daytime
- Needs structured activity blocks (crafts, light physio, garden walk) to prevent disinhibition.
- Encourage hourly fluid round with thickened squash; record acceptance on fluid chart.

### Evening & Night
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Provide visual timetable updated each shift
- Encourage pacing techniques during transfers
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Use tablet-based social stories before appointments

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence
- Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room
- Allow recovery time without demands
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- GP adjusts diuretics based on weight trends
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- Refer for urgent ECG if arrhythmia suspected
- Learning disability nurse provides quarterly review
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | High-salt meals | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Unfamiliar carers approaching without introduction | Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Meltdowns leading to self-injury | Clothing labels causing itch | Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.

---

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Sensory regulation log
- Food intake chart when new menu trialled
- Incident review template
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
