| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability | Communicates with short phrases, uses tablet for choice boards. | Incident review template / Linked team: Learning Disability Nurse |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy | Baseline saturation 92%; productive cough in mornings. | Nebuliser maintenance log / Linked team: Dietitian |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression | May decline care, experiences nightmares, hypervigilant to loud voices. | Safeguarding notes kept confidentially / Linked team: Community Mental Health Team |

## Presenting Needs, Triggers, and Risks

**Key triggers / early warning signs:**
- Male voices shouting
- Delayed Parkinson's medication
- Fatigue following physiotherapy
- Unexpected touch from behind
- Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking
- Rapid positional changes causing dizziness

**Associated risks if unmet:**
- Meltdowns leading to self-injury
- Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation
- High falls risk when mobilising impulsively
- Isolation if peers misunderstand communication
- Muscle rigidity leading to pain

**Observed strengths and protective factors:**
- Responds to storytelling about earlier career and music.
- Engages well with consistent staff pairing.
- Family provides collateral information when mental state fluctuates.

## Daily Rhythm and Support Offers

### Morning
- Medication window 07:30-08:00; crush tablets only if SALT guidance permits.
- Uses reminiscence playlist while carers complete dressing to reduce anxiety.

### Daytime
- May nap after lunch; ensure heels are offloaded and oxygen concentrator checked.
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.

### Evening & Night
- Night medication at 21:00 accompanied by malt drink; monitor for choking risk.
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Encourage grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Medication must be administered exactly on time using individual timers
- Offer choice of female carers for personal care
- Offer sensory diet (deep pressure, weighted lap pad)
- Encourage breathing exercises with physio
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Increase observation frequency during infection
- For sudden breathlessness, sit upright, pursed-lip breathing, start rescue pack if prescribed

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Respiratory nurse reviews every 3 months
- Physio leads quarterly moving and handling refreshers
- Learning disability nurse provides quarterly review
- SALT monitors swallowing competence
- Psychiatrist oversees medication annually

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Muscle rigidity leading to pain | Rapid positional changes causing dizziness | If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance |
| COPD with long-term oxygen therapy - CO2 retention if oxygen exceeds prescription | Anxiety causing rapid breathing | Escalate to 111/999 if saturation <88% after interventions |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Food refusal if textures disliked | Staff speaking over each other | Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Nightmares leading to disorientation | Use trauma-informed language, acknowledge feelings, avoid restraint |

**Escalation reminders:**
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes
- Family update log maintained weekly
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
