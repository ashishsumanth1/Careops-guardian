| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation | Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
