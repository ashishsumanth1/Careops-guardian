### Evening & Night
- Hourly safety checks overnight with gentle torch to avoid startling.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Offer memory box and narrated photo book before personal care
- Provide visual timetable updated each shift
- Daily weight monitoring before breakfast
- Allow extra time for verbal responses
- Strict fluid balance sheet
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation
- If freezing, encourage rhythmic counting and provide light touch guidance
- Sit or lie service user at first sign of dizziness, monitor BP
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Learning disability nurse provides quarterly review
- Admiral nurse provides monthly coaching to staff
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Psychiatrist oversees medication annually

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - High falls risk when mobilising impulsively | Pain or discomfort not verbalised | Reduce stimuli, offer weighted blanket, and provide one-to-one presence |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Muscle rigidity leading to pain | Thin fluids leading to coughing | If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse |
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Skin breakdown over ankles | High-salt meals | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Meltdowns leading to self-injury | Unexpected schedule changes | Offer noise-cancelling headphones and dark room |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
- If blood glucose <4 mmol/L or >18 mmol/L, follow diabetes emergency plan and inform GP/diabetes nurse.

## Monitoring & Professional Oversight

**Required monitoring data sets:**
- Record BP lying and standing twice weekly
- Meal charts noting cough/choke incidents
- Daily Parkinson's symptom log
- Hourly wellbeing checks between 17:00-22:00
- ABC chart for any escalation beyond 10 minutes
- Family update log maintained weekly

**Documentation expectations:**
- Care notes updated in real time with clear ABC entries for behavioural changes.
- Family communication log maintained weekly (or sooner following incidents).
- Capacity and best-interest records stored with safeguarding folder.

## Goals for the Next 12 Weeks

1. Maintain safety by reducing unplanned exits/falls to zero incidents through environmental cues and engagement.  
2. Achieve >85% adherence to personalised routine (measured via intentional rounding audits).  
3. Stabilise mood and sleep hygiene using co-produced bedtime plan and MDT oversight.  
4. Protect skin integrity and nutritional status through proactive monitoring and timely clinical escalation.  
5. Keep family/advocates involved with monthly MDT reviews and documented shared decisions.
