### Daytime
- Prefers chair exercises led by physio assistant; monitor for shortness of breath.
- Benefits from sensory box (fabric swatches, lavender oil) during quieter periods.

### Evening & Night
- Encourage family video call after tea to reduce exit-seeking thoughts.
- Sundowning begins circa 17:00; dim overhead lights and switch to warm lamps.

## Proactive, Therapeutic, and Reactive Support

**Proactive approaches (embed every shift):**
- Allow extra time for verbal responses
- Ensure podiatry-approved footwear only
- Provide soft diet with Stage 2 thickened fluids
- Use lavender diffuser and soft lighting from 16:30
- Offer low-GI snacks at 10:30 and 20:30
- Provide safe space with comforting textiles

**Reactive / de-escalation responses:**
- If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands
- Use validation therapy, acknowledge feelings, and redirect to safe space
- If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test
- Offer PRN anxiolytic only after debrief
- If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation

**Clinical oversight / scheduled tasks:**
- Pain clinic oversees neuropathy medications
- GP reviews memantine and antidepressant regime quarterly
- Community heart failure nurse reviews monthly
- Capacity assessments documented for high-risk decisions
- CMHT reviews antidepressant therapy bi-monthly

## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | High-salt meals | Apply emollient and support stockings as prescribed |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Risk of missing medication due to confusion | Sundowning after 17:00 leading to exit seeking | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Suicidal ideation (historical) | Unexpected touch from behind | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Mood changes linked to sugar fluctuations | Footwear rubbing or slipping | If hyperglycaemic >18 mmol/L, alert nurse and repeat test |
| Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and orthostatic hypotension - Syncope due to blood pressure drops | Delayed Parkinson's medication | If coughing persists, stop meal and alert nurse |

**Escalation reminders:**
- Safeguarding triggers (unexplained bruising, disclosures) must be reported to manager immediately and logged on safeguarding portal.
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
