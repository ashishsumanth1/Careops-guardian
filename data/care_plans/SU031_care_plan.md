## Risk and Contingency Matrix

| Risk / Scenario | Warning Signs | Staff Response / Escalation |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Chronic heart failure with recurrent oedema - Flash pulmonary oedema | Emotional distress increasing heart rate | If breathless at rest, sit upright, use fan therapy, start NEWS escalation |
| Complex PTSD with recurrent depression - Heightened anxiety leading to aggression | Male voices shouting | If dissociating, provide warm drink and guide breathing |
| Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - Foot ulceration | Delayed meals | Report redness on feet immediately and photograph |
| Advanced mixed dementia with sundowning - Potential for safeguarding disclosures needing validation | Large groups or overlapping conversations | If disinhibited, offer folded laundry task to occupy hands |
| Autism spectrum condition with learning disability - Meltdowns leading to self-injury | Strong smells in dining room | Implement low-arousal response, minimal speech |

**Escalation reminders:**
- For oxygen saturation < 90% despite prescribed therapy, initiate NEWS scoring and call 111 for clinical advice.
- Unwitnessed falls with head impact require 24-hour neuro observations and GP review; call 999 if deterioration noted.
